Repository containing code to estimate small-area impacts, following the methods in the article “Statistical approaches to estimate impact in small areas:   a comparison with a focus on youth suicide prevention in rural counties.” All analysis scripts live in the analysis/ folder as sequentially numbered R Markdown files. Because low event counts, the real data cannot be shared; the outcome variable in this repo is generated synthetically to illustrate the workflow.”
